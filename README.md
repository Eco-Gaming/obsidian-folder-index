# Folder Index for Obsidian

## Features
 - Automatic index file generation
 - Hiding index files in the file browser
 - Automatically renaming index files when renaming the folder

### Manual Installation
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/turulix/obsidian-folder-index/releases) and download the ZIP file from the latest release.
2. This ZIP file should be extracted in your Obsidian plugins folder. If you don't know where that is, you can go to `Community Plugins` inside Obsidian. There is a folder icon on the right of `Installed Plugins`. Click that and it opens your plugins folder.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file there.
4. Now you should have a folder in plugins called 'obsidian-folder-index' containing a `main.js` file, `manifest.json` file, and a `styles.css` file.

### Donations
I literally spend multiple nights reverse engineering obsidian to fix bugs that annoyed me.
Like the graph not properly showing the connections because the lists are rendered after the fact.
So if you want to donate me a coffee you can do so at<br><br>
